(sequence instances of onomatopoeia read aloud with the web speech api)

The web speech api reads aloud selected instances of onomatopoeia listed. Click on an instance to add it to the sequence. The idea is to create a musical pattern out of these spoken words that sound like instrument sounds. The sequence is determined by an array called "notes". In order to create a new sequence the page must be reloaded. This action could be avoided by adding something like the array.splice method to remove notes from the sequence.
